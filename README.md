Check out the **live Streamlit demo** here:  [MediMine Application 🩺]([https://e5zt7dvjjxiioxe2sbutcu.streamlit.app/](https://medimine-application-bg7bcw2ukmizfkejnaxhxg.streamlit.app/]) 

## Project Overview
AI-powered system for predicting the most likely diseases and generating personalized recommendations using text similarity & embeddings.
This system scrapes medical data from NHS Inform, processes it using various ML models (Clustering, BiLSTM, BioBERT), and provides diagnosis predictions through a Flask API.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Web scraping from NHS Inform A-Z conditions
- **Multiple Models**: 
  - Clustering analysis (by [Naira Ahmed])
  - BiLSTM neural network (by [])
  - BioBERT transformer model (by [])
- **RESTful API**: Flask-based endpoints for scraping and predictions
- **MongoDB Integration**: For data storage and model management

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)
